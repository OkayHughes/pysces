A dictionary of inaccessible jargon
===================================
Computational atmospheric modeling is older than the digital computer, and as soon
as digital computers were available, people were writing dynamical cores for them.
The design decisions that govern a modern dynamical core (GPU-readiness, suitability
for high resolution modeling, etc) are completely different from what governed dynamical cores
15 years ago, let alone 70 years ago. Consequently, there is an immense amount of tacit knowledge
that goes into designing a good dynamical core, and the code of almost all operational models
is completely foreboding to non-specialists. I've tried to remove a decent amount of the
jargon from this codebase where it was no longer serving a function. Some jargon remains. This page
helps clarify some of it
